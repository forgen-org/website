# Event sourcing

### **1. Definition**

- **Event Sourcing:**
    - Event Sourcing involves storing each state change to the application's state as an immutable event object.
    - Events are stored sequentially, allowing the state of an application to be reconstructed at any point in time by replaying the events.

- **Mutation-Based Architecture:**
    - The application's state is mutable and is changed directly by operations.
    - The current state is usually stored in a database, and previous states are typically lost or overwritten.

### **2. Advantages of Event-Sourced Architecture**
- **Immutability:** Every state change is stored as an immutable event, reducing the risk of data corruption and inconsistencies.
- **Audit:** Regulatory compliance and troubleshooting are made easier.
- **Flexible:** Ability to reconstruct the system state at any point in time, providing powerful insights and debugging capabilities.
- **Scalable:** Read and write concerns are decoupled, enabling better scalability options.
