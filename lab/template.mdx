import { Tabs, Tab } from 'nextra/components'

# Title

## Context

## Decision

We decided to adopt Fluent Interfaces as our main design pattern. Fluent Interfaces allow for method chaining to create a more readable and concise API, which can help in mitigating the issues found in OOP and FP by providing a clear and efficient way to construct object instances without mixing data with logic and avoiding module conflicts and integrity breaches.

## How to Implement

<Tabs items={['Rust', 'Typescript']}>
<Tab>
```rust
```
</Tab>
<Tab>
```ts
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>
