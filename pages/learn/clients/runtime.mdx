# Runtime

A runtime is an essential concept in clean/hexagonal architecture, especially within the context of command and query execution in the client layer. It is essentially a composite of all necessary traits to execute the commands and queries in your application.

## Understanding Runtime

The runtime serves as the execution context for your application's operations. It's where your application's logic comes to life, interacting with various services, repositories, and stores.

### Core Characteristics:

- **Combination of Traits**: It aggregates all the necessary traits to execute commands and queries.
- **Execution Context**: Provides the necessary context and dependencies for executing operations.
- **Delegate Pattern**: To enhance the development experience, runtimes utilize the delegate pattern, which the framework crate directly exposes.

## Creating a Runtime

Creating a runtime involves defining a struct that includes all the necessary traits and services your application requires. Here's an example of how you might define a runtime in Rust using the delegate pattern:

<Tabs items={['Rust']}>
<Tab>
```rust filename="client/runtime.rs"
use framework::*;

#[derive(Default, Delegate)]
pub struct Runtime {
    #[to(TodoListStore, TodoListRepository)]
    store: services::memstore::MemStore,
}
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

This `Runtime` struct becomes the backbone of your application's client layer, orchestrating the interactions between different components.

## Utilizing Runtime

Once defined, the runtime is instantiated in the main function of the client and passed to the execute function of commands and queries.

### Execute Trait

The `Execute` trait is a fundamental part of this process, defining how an operation is executed within the context of a given runtime.

<Tabs items={['Rust']}>
<Tab>
```rust filename="traits/execute.rs"
#[async_trait]
pub trait Execute<R> {
    type Output = ();
    type Error: Display = AnyError;

    async fn execute(&self, runtime: &R) -> Result<Self::Output, Self::Error>;
}
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

### Command Execution Example

Here's an example of a command that utilizes a runtime to execute its operations:

<Tabs items={['Rust']}>
<Tab>
```rust filename="commands/todo_list_command.rs"
#[async_trait]
impl<R> Execute<R> for Command
where
    R: TodoListRepository + TodoListStore + Send + Sync,
{
    async fn execute(&self, runtime: &R) -> AnyResult<()> {
        let message = self.try_into()?;

        // Pull the current state and apply the message
        let todolist = TodoListStore::pull(runtime).await?;
        let new_events = todolist.send(&message)?;
        TodoListStore::push(runtime, &new_events).await?;

        // Save the projection
        let mut projection = TodoListRepository::fetch(runtime).await?;
        projection.apply(&new_events);
        TodoListRepository::save(runtime, &projection).await?;

        Ok(())
    }
}
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

In this example, the command interacts with the runtime to pull the current state, apply changes, and then save the updated state back through the store and repository.
