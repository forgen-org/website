# Features

A Service will likely depend on external libraries that might be heavy to load and unecessary to some client. For example, if you have a web server and an app sharing some logic, you might want to import `sqlx` only in the web server and use some in-memory caching in the app.

To do so, you can either split your services into different crates or use the `features` attribute in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml filename="services/Cargo.toml.rs"
[dependencies]
sqlx = { version = "1", optional = true }

[features]
pgstore = ["dep:sqlx"]
```

```rust filename="services/src/lib.rs"
#[cfg(feature = "pgstore")]
pub mod pgstore {
    use sqlx::PgPool;
    // ...
}
```

```toml filename="client/server/Cargo.toml.rs"
[dependencies]
service = { path = "../../services", features = ["pgstore"] }
```
