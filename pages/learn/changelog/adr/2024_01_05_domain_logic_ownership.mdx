# Domain Logic Ownership

**Date: 2024-01-05**

Who should implement the business logic (aka `send` and `apply`) between `Event` and `State`?

```rust
trait Event {
    fn apply(&self, state: &mut State);
}

// OR

trait State {
    fn apply(&mut self, event: &Event);
}
```

When doing Dependency Injection, following Effect principles, it is preferable to use the context at the last moment so that basic elements can be built and exchanged.

```rust
// ‚úÖ Good 
struct Command {} // Can be built without knowing the context

impl Command {
  fn execute(&self, context: &Context) -> (); // Also, this pattern allows us to implement variations depending on the context
}

// ‚ùå Bad
struct Command {
  context: Context // Cannot be built without knowing the context, need to be owned and/or to have a lifetime
}
```

In our case, the `Event` is the basic element and the `State` is the context. Thus, it is preferable to use the `State` at the last moment, which means that the `Event` should implement `apply`.

However, we also have `Projection` that need to apply events and we cannot implement `Vec<Event>` from the application layer.
