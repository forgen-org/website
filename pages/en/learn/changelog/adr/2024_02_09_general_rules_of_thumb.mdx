# General rules of thumb

**Date: 2024-02-09**

I have been regularly going back and forth between styles and patterns in Rust so I decided to write down some rules of thumb that I should remember.

## Representing Commands and Queries

Because **Commands** share some behaviours and have the same return type, it is tempting to do like this:

```rs
enum Command {
    Create,
    Update,
    Delete,
}

impl Command {
  // ...
}
```

However, for **Queries** it is not possible because they don't share the same return type. So, we have to do like this:

```rs
struct GetUser {
    id: Uuid,
}

struct GetUsers {
    page: i32,
    limit: i32,
}
```

For better consistency, we should do the same for **Commands** and put the shared logic into a **Listener**:

```rs

impl<R> Execute<R> for Create {
    fn execute(&self, runtime: R) {
      // ...
      self.listen(events).await;
    }
}

impl<R> Listen for R
where
    R: AuthStore + UserRepository,
{
    type Event = Event;
    type Error = ServiceError;

    async fn listen(&self, events: &[Self::Event]) -> Result<(), Self::Error> {
        // ...
    }
}
```

## Some naming conventions

1. Keep the name simple and work with modules. For example, instead of `UserRepository`, use `user::Repository`.
2. Use verbs for **Commands** and **Queries**.
3. Traits should not overlap common names such as **Event** or **Projection**, use a verb to describe the action. For example, `Listen` or `Execute`.

## Generics in traits

In Rust there are two ways of putting generics in traits :

```rs
trait MyTrait<T> {
    fn my_method(&self, t: T);
}

trait MyTrait {
    type T;
    fn my_method(&self, t: Self::T);
}
```

They both have some use cases but try to use the second one as it is more flexible and explicit.

```rs
trait Execute<R> {
  type Error;
  fn execute(&self, runtime: R) -> Result<(), Error>;
}
```

Here, it is useful to use R as a generic here because we can define the `Execute` trait multiple times on a same struct for different runtimes. However it is unlikely that we need to define it for different `Error` types. In other words, for a given `Runtime`, the `Error` should be always the same.
