# Scalars

Scalars are the basic building blocks of a domain model. They are the primitive types that represent the data in your domain. They are the nouns of your domain model.

## Using Newtypes

It is recommended to use newtypes to represent domain-specific values. This will help you to avoid mixing up values of the same type. For example, a bank account balance is a `f64`, but a transaction amount is also a `f64`. If you use the same type for both, you might end up adding a transaction amount to a bank account balance, which is not what you want. We might also want our balance to have only two decimal places, so we can use a newtype to represent it.

    pub balance: Balance,
}

#[derive(Default, Debug)]
pub struct Balance(f64);

impl Balance {
pub fn parse(value: f64) -> Self {
let value = (value \* 100.0).round() / 100.0;
Self(value)
}
}
