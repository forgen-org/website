# Runtime

A runtime is an essential concept in clean/hexagonal architecture, especially within the context of command and query execution in the client layer. It is essentially a composite of all necessary traits to execute the commands and queries in your application.

## Understanding Runtime

The runtime serves as the execution context for your application's operations. It's where your application's logic comes to life, interacting with various services, repositories, and stores.

### Core Characteristics:

- **Combination of Traits**: It aggregates all the necessary traits to execute commands and queries.
- **Execution Context**: Provides the necessary context and dependencies for executing operations.
- **Delegate Pattern**: To enhance the development experience, runtimes utilize the delegate pattern, which the framework crate directly exposes.

## Creating a Runtime

Creating a runtime involves defining a struct that includes all the necessary traits and services your application requires. Here's an example of how you might define a runtime in Rust using the delegate pattern:

<Tabs items={['Rust']}>
<Tabs.Tab>
```rust filename="clients/axum/src/runtime.rs" url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/forgen-org/todo/ce9213676b2ebbd6532aed184f50fee13fd2684c/clients/axum/src/runtime.rs
```

</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

This `Runtime` struct becomes the backbone of your application's client layer, orchestrating the interactions between different components.
