Ports are one of the key components that facilitate the separation of concerns, making systems more modular and adaptable.

- **Interaction Points**: Serve as the primary points of interaction between the application's core logic and the outside world.
- **Abstractions**: Define abstract interfaces for the core application to communicate with external elements like databases, user interfaces, and external services.

## Implementing Ports

Ports are implemented as interfaces or abstract classes, depending on the programming language used.
