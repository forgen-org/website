Commands describe an intent to change the system's state. They have side-effects and interact with the write model. They are used to encapsulate application logic and are often used to implement use cases. They don't return a value, but they can fail.

- **Intent-Driven**: Commands represent a clear intention to change the system's state.
- **Action-Oriented**: Unlike queries, which request data, commands perform actions that modify state.
- **Task-Specific**: Each command is designed for a specific operation, ensuring clarity and purpose.

## Creating Commands

It is recommended to create a command for each application use case.
