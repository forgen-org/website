Projections are used to create read models or views from the series of events or state changes that occur in the system. The role of a projection is to transform a state into a more readable or convenient format, often optimized for queries.

- **Data Transformation**: Projections transform event-sourced data (state changes) into a format suitable for querying and display.
- **Read Optimization**: They create read models optimized for performance and specific use cases.
