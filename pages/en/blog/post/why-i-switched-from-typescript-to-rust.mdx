title: Why I switched from Typescript to Rust
---

After nearly a year of diving into Rust, transitioning from a TypeScript background, I can wholeheartedly say I have no regrets. The journey has been enlightening, challenging, and rewarding. Rust, a language empowering everyone to build reliable and efficient software, has features that particularly stand out and address some of the limitations I faced in TypeScript. Here are my reflections on this shift:

## 1. Rust Native Newtypes

Rust's approach to newtypes is something I greatly appreciate. Unlike TypeScript, where we often rely on type aliases, Rust newtypes provide a way to create distinct types. This adds a layer of type safety, preventing accidental mixing of types.

```rust
struct Kilometers(i32);
struct Miles(i32);

fn travel(distance: Kilometers) {
    // Function logic specific to Kilometers
}
```

Example usage:

```rust
let distance = Kilometers(15);
travel(distance);
```

## 2. The Power of From/Into Traits

The `From` and `Into` traits in Rust are a game-changer, simplifying conversions between types. This is a step up from TypeScript's more manual and error-prone type conversions.

```rust
struct Circle {
    radius: f64,
}

struct Square {
    side: f64,
}

impl From<Square> for Circle {
    fn from(square: Square) -> Self {
        Circle { radius: square.side * 0.5 }
    }
}

// Usage
let square = Square { side: 4.0 };
let circle: Circle = square.into();
```

## 3. Multiplatform Support

Rust's multiplatform capabilities are impressive. It seamlessly supports various platforms, which was often a challenge in the TypeScript/JavaScript ecosystem, especially when dealing with native modules.

- WASM: https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/
- UniFFI: https://mozilla.github.io/uniffi-rs/

## 4. Uncompromising Type Safety

Rust takes type safety to another level. There's no equivalent to TypeScript's `"as any"` workaround. Rust's strict type system ensures more robust and reliable code.

```rust
let number: i32 = 5;
let text: String = "Hello".to_string();

// This will result in a compile-time error
let result: i32 = number + text;
```

## 5. Cargo Features

The Cargo package manager's feature flags allow for adding optional features to a library without bloating the crate size. Users can opt-in to features they need, which is a more flexible approach compared to npm packages.

Example of conditional compilation:

```rust
#[cfg(feature = "json_support")]
fn process_json() {
    // Functionality available only when the 'json_support' feature is enabled
}
```

## 6. Cargo Workspace

Unlike the often troublesome npm workspaces, Rust's Cargo workspace is a joy to work with. It eliminates the need for complex setups like turborepo, streamlining the development process.

```toml
[workspace]
members = [
    "crate1",
    "crate2",
]
```

## 7. Performance Gains

Rust's performance is stellar. The efficient compilation to machine code means faster execution, a significant step up from the interpreted nature of TypeScript.

## 8. Option & Result Types

Rust's `Option` and `Result` types elegantly handle the presence or absence of values and error handling, respectively. This approach is more intuitive and less error-prone than TypeScript's `undefined`, `null`, or exceptions.

```rust
fn find_value(key: &str) -> Option<&str> {
    // Returns Some(value) if found, or None otherwise
}

fn process_data(data: &str) -> Result<(), MyError> {
    // Returns Ok(()) if successful, or Err(MyError) if an error occurs
}
```

## 9. Clear Separation of Data and Implementation

Rust enforces a clear separation between data (structs) and behavior (impls). This leads to more organized and maintainable code, as opposed to TypeScript's more flexible, but sometimes chaotic, structure.

```rust
struct Data {
    // fields
}

impl Data {
    fn process(&self) {
        // method implementation
    }
}
```

## What I Miss from TypeScript

Despite the many benefits, there are a few things I miss from TypeScript:

### 1. **Easy Lambda Functions**

Rust's `Fn` trait isn't as straightforward as TypeScript's arrow functions. Rust requires more boilerplate for closures, especially when dealing with lifetimes or async functions.

```rust
let add_one = |x: i32| x + 1;

// Rust's equivalent of an async function with a requirement R, a return type T, and an error type E
type Lambda<R, T, E> = Box<dyn Fn(R) -> Pin<Box<dyn Future<Output = Result<T, E>> + Send + Sync>>>;
```

### 2. **Type Inference**

TypeScript's type inference is more flexible. In Rust, explicit type declarations are more common, which can be verbose.

```rust
let number = 5; // Rust infers the type as i32

fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 { // Explicit type declaration
    a + b
}
```

```typescript
const number = 5 // TypeScript infers the type as number

function add(a: number, b: number) {
  // No explicit type declaration, add return type is of type number
  return a + b
}
```

### 3. **Union Types**

Rust requires using enums to achieve what TypeScript does with union types. This can sometimes lead to more verbose code.

```rust
enum MyUnion {
    Num(i32),
    Text(String),
}
```

In conclusion, transitioning to Rust has been a rewarding experience. While there are aspects of TypeScript I miss, Rust's robustness, performance, and type safety make it an excellent choice for many projects. The journey from TypeScript to Rust has been one of growth and learning, and I look forward to continuing
